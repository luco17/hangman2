This is a simple Hangman game I built to better my understanding of functional components. It borrows a lot from this [project](https://github.com/TyeCampbell/react-hangman/blob/master/src/Hangman.js) by TyeCampbell, and thanks also to this [video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj0W8tYX_q8) from Traversy Media/CodeSTACKR.
